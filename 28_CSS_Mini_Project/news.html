			<p>MacBook Air lasts up to an incredible 12 hours between charges. So from your morning coffee to your evening commute, you can work unplugged. When it’s time to kick back and relax, you can get up to 12 hours of iTunes movie playback. And with up to 30 days of standby time, you can go away for weeks and pick up where you left off.*</p>

				<p>Samsung is set to unveil the Galaxy S9, its first flagship phone of the year, on February 25, one day ahead of the MWC 2018 in Barcelona. Both the Galaxy S9 and S9+ have been part of several leaks and rumours. Almost everything is now known about these phones. The Galaxy S9 and its plus variant will succeed the Galaxy S8 and S8+ from last year. A new report now says that the Galaxy S9 and S9+ will come with a battery that will have the same size as the one inside the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+.</p>

			<p>There are a few reasons that make one believe that 2017 was not the best year for Apple. Despite the launch of the much-awaited and glamorous iPhone X, delays in production made it perform less favourably as per analysts. Side-by-side, Apple also rolled out iOS 11, its biggest software update to date. Unfortunately, Apple’s biggest software update was also its buggiest one in a long time. This is perhaps why the company could be taking this year to reflect on its software and figure out how it can make the existing one better before coming up with new features.</p>
